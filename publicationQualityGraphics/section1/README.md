## 1. Data handling

One thing that most people fail to acknowledge is that visualising data in R (or any other programming language for that matter) usually involves a little more effort than simply calling some plot function to create a meaningful graph. Data visualisation is in essence an abstract representation of raw data. Most plotting routines available in R, however, are not designed to provide any useful data abstraction. This means that it is up to us to prepare our data to a level of abstraction that is feasible for what we want to show with our visualisation.   
Therefore, before we start to produce plots, we will need to spend some time and effort get familiar with some tools to manipulate our raw data sets.

In particular, we will learn how to **subset**, **aggregate**, **sort** & **merge** our data sets.

**Right, enough of that introductory talk, let's start getting our hands dirty...**
