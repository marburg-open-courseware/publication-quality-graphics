##### Put other setup R code here
clrs_hcl <- function(n) {
  hcl(h = seq(230, 0, length.out = n), 
      c = 60, l = seq(10, 90, length.out = n),

### Final remarks

Ok, so now we have a rather comprehensive, though far from complete (if that is even possible) set of tools for visualising our data using classical statistical plots.

I hope that this tutorial was, at least in parts, useful for some of you and that we were able to expand your skill set of producing publication quality graphics using R to some extent.

As mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial, I am happy to receive feedback, comments, criticism and bug reports at the e-mail address provided.

Cheers
